## 1. Maturity Level Descriptions

These descriptions are shown at the top of the results page, under the circular score diagram.

### AI-Curious

Your team is clearly interested in AI and already exploring its potential, but most initiatives are still informal and driven by individual enthusiasm. This is a healthy starting point: curiosity means there is energy and openness to change. At the same time, the lack of shared language, clear priorities, and agreed rules creates a risk that efforts will stay fragmented and hard to scale. The main opportunity at this stage is to align the team around what AI means for your work, where it should be used, and what "good" looks like before moving deeper into technical implementation.

### AI-Enabled

Your team has moved beyond curiosity and already applies AI in real tasks and pilots. Some practices work well, and there are visible wins. However, AI usage is still uneven: different people and sub-teams use it in different ways, and results depend heavily on individual skills. This stage is about turning isolated successes into repeatable practices. With clearer standards, shared tooling approaches, and explicit expectations, your team can reduce friction and prepare for more ambitious AI initiatives.

### AI-Driven

AI is already part of how your team operates and delivers results. You are not just experimenting — you are integrating AI into products, processes, or workflows and seeing measurable impact. The key challenge at this level is reliability and scale: making sure solutions are robust, maintainable, and understandable by the whole team. Strengthening engineering discipline, evaluation, and ownership will help ensure that AI remains a long-term advantage rather than a source of hidden complexity.

### AI-Native

AI is deeply embedded in your team's strategy, culture, and technical systems. Decisions about tools, processes, and architecture naturally include AI considerations, and the team treats AI as a core capability rather than an add-on. At this level, the focus shifts from adoption to leadership: refining platforms, sharing best practices, and continuously improving how AI is governed and evolved. Your main opportunity is to stay intentional and disciplined as you scale, ensuring that maturity does not turn into complacency.

## 4. Overall Team Patterns

These patterns are detected based on score combinations and shown at the top of the Team Profile section.

### Pattern 1: High individual energy + Low organizational structure = Fragile progress
**When shown:** Skills > 3.5 AND Strategy < 2.8  
**Description:** This is common for teams at your stage. The good news is that you have the raw ingredients (skills, interest). The opportunity is to add structure around them.

### Pattern 2: Active tool usage + Weak foundation = Technical debt risk
**When shown:** Tools > 3.5 AND Data Infrastructure < 2.8  
**Description:** Your team is using AI actively, but the underlying infrastructure isn't keeping up. This creates risk of brittle solutions that are hard to maintain.

### Pattern 3: Early exploration phase
**When shown:** Average constraint score < 2.5  
**Description:** You're at the beginning of the AI journey. The key now is to build foundations: alignment, skills, and basic practices before scaling up.

### Pattern 4: Strong foundation in place
**When shown:** Average strength score > 3.8  
**Description:** You have solid capabilities across multiple areas. The opportunity is to scale what's working and address remaining gaps systematically.

### Pattern 5: Building AI capabilities systematically
**When shown:** Default (all other cases)  
**Description:** You're making progress across multiple dimensions. The key is to maintain momentum while addressing the specific gaps that hold you back.

## 7. Product Recommendations

These recommendations are shown at the bottom of the results page based on scoring patterns.

### AI Foundations Training

**Name:** AI foundations training

**Description:** Your assessment results suggest that the main challenge right now is alignment rather than technology. Your team is curious about AI and already experimenting, but there is no shared language yet around what AI is, where it should be used, and what good usage looks like. This is a very common and healthy stage.

**Why this helps:** AI foundations training gives your cross-functional team a common mental model of LLMs, agents, and AI workflows. Instead of relying on individual intuition, the team learns to reason about AI in the same way and make decisions together.

**What will change:** After the program, discussions about AI become clearer, experiments feel safer, and your team can move forward without internal friction or uncertainty about basic concepts.

**When recommended:**
- Alignment signal < 3.2
- OR AI Readiness Index < 2.5 (early stage)

---

### AI Engineering Training

**Name:** AI engineering training

**Description:** Your team is already actively working with AI and exploring product-level use cases. The ambition is there, but the results show gaps in engineering depth: data readiness, evaluation, deployment, and long-term maintenance. This usually means that prototypes appear quickly, but scaling them becomes stressful and unpredictable.

**Why this helps:** AI engineering training focuses on the full lifecycle of AI-based products. It helps your engineers move from experiments to production-ready systems with clear ownership, testing, monitoring, and metrics.

**What will change:** Within a few months, your team will be able to build AI-powered solutions that are not only impressive demos, but stable, debuggable, and ready to support real users and business processes.

**When recommended:**
- Alignment >= 3.2 AND Experimentation >= 3.2 AND Engineering Depth < 3.4
- OR AI Readiness Index 2.5-3.5 (intermediate stage)

---

### AI-Driven Software Development Workshops

**Name:** AI-driven software development workshops

**Description:** Your results indicate a mature engineering team that already understands AI fundamentals. The main opportunity now is to integrate AI more deeply into everyday development workflows: coding, reviews, maintenance, and quality control.

**Why this helps:** The workshops are short, focused, and hands-on. They work directly with your team's real code and processes, showing how coding agents, pull-request workflows, and AI-assisted maintenance can speed up delivery without sacrificing quality.

**What will change:** You should see immediate productivity gains and more consistent use of AI across the team, without the overhead of a long training program or a full reset of existing practices.

**When recommended:**
- Alignment >= 3.2 AND Workflow Acceleration >= 3.4 AND Engineering Depth >= 3.2
- OR AI Readiness Index >= 3.5 (advanced stage)
