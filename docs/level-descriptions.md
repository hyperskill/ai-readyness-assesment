# AI Readiness Levels — Executive Summaries for Team Leads

These summaries are written to be constructive, respectful, and useful for planning.
They are meant to help team leads reflect on the current state and see a clear next step.

## AI-Curious

Your team is clearly interested in AI and already exploring its potential, but most initiatives are still informal and driven by individual enthusiasm. This is a healthy starting point: curiosity means there is energy and openness to change. At the same time, the lack of shared language, clear priorities, and agreed rules creates a risk that efforts will stay fragmented and hard to scale. The main opportunity at this stage is to align the team around what AI means for your work, where it should be used, and what “good” looks like before moving deeper into technical implementation.

## AI-Enabled

Your team has moved beyond curiosity and already applies AI in real tasks and pilots. Some practices work well, and there are visible wins. However, AI usage is still uneven: different people and sub-teams use it in different ways, and results depend heavily on individual skills. This stage is about turning isolated successes into repeatable practices. With clearer standards, shared tooling approaches, and explicit expectations, your team can reduce friction and prepare for more ambitious AI initiatives.

## AI-Driven

AI is already part of how your team operates and delivers results. You are not just experimenting — you are integrating AI into products, processes, or workflows and seeing measurable impact. The key challenge at this level is reliability and scale: making sure solutions are robust, maintainable, and understandable by the whole team. Strengthening engineering discipline, evaluation, and ownership will help ensure that AI remains a long-term advantage rather than a source of hidden complexity.

## AI-Native

AI is deeply embedded in your team’s strategy, culture, and technical systems. Decisions about tools, processes, and architecture naturally include AI considerations, and the team treats AI as a core capability rather than an add-on. At this level, the focus shifts from adoption to leadership: refining platforms, sharing best practices, and continuously improving how AI is governed and evolved. Your main opportunity is to stay intentional and disciplined as you scale, ensuring that maturity does not turn into complacency.
