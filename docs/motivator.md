## Main Headline

Nearly every team today uses AI.  
Far fewer use it deliberately, consistently and in a way that will scale.

## Assessment Purpose

This 10-minute team assessment helps you quickly check:

- how intentional your team's AI usage really is
- where value is leaking: strategy & culture, data & governance, tooling, skills, product & processes, security, experimentation, integration, and impact measurement
- how prepared your team is for the next 12 months

## Design Principles

The text is designed to:

1. **Be direct and practical** — No jargon, no academic framing
2. **Acknowledge reality** — Most teams already use AI
3. **Surface the real question** — Not "Do you use AI?" but "How deliberately?"
4. **Promise actionable insight** — Where value leaks, what to fix
5. **Respect time** — 10 minutes, not hours
6. **Focus on what matters** — 9 specific areas that drive AI success

## Previous Version (archived)

Most teams are already using AI in one way or another.
The harder question is whether this use is intentional, sustainable, and aligned with where the team is heading next.

This short assessment is designed as a practical self-check for team leads.
It helps you step back and see how AI fits into your team's strategy, workflows, skills, and risks — not just today, but looking ahead to the next year.

There are no "right" or "wrong" answers here.
The value comes from noticing what is already working, where things are still fuzzy, and which areas might quietly become bottlenecks as AI usage grows.

By the end, you'll get a clear snapshot of your team's AI readiness, a breakdown of strengths and gaps, and a thoughtful suggestion for what the most natural next step could be — whether that means alignment, deeper engineering practices, or practical workflow improvements.

Take it as a pause for reflection, not a test.
