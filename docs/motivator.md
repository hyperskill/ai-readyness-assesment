Most teams are already using AI in one way or another.
The harder question is whether this use is intentional, sustainable, and aligned with where the team is heading next.

This short assessment is designed as a practical self-check for team leads.
It helps you step back and see how AI fits into your team’s strategy, workflows, skills, and risks — not just today, but looking ahead to the next year.

There are no “right” or “wrong” answers here.
The value comes from noticing what is already working, where things are still fuzzy, and which areas might quietly become bottlenecks as AI usage grows.

By the end, you’ll get a clear snapshot of your team’s AI readiness, a breakdown of strengths and gaps, and a thoughtful suggestion for what the most natural next step could be — whether that means alignment, deeper engineering practices, or practical workflow improvements.

Take it as a pause for reflection, not a test.
